![sbgifp-demo-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56745633/151171675-ca77301b-4b96-45d2-a2eb-df544bb6a593.gif)

The protocol is as follows:

Middle -> out = more central to your identity -> less central to your identity.

Saturation = extent

green: fluid<br/>
pink: feminine<br/>
blue: masculine<br/>
purple: bigender<br/>
yellow: genderqueer (or non-binary, androgynous)<br/>
gray: agender<br/>
white: static (non-fluid)<br/>
